🚘 MechaMind+
Intelligent Vehicle Health & Fault Diagnostics with Real-Time Sensor Insights and GenAI

🧠 Overview
MechaMind+ is a hybrid AI-driven vehicle diagnostics platform that reads real-time data from live or emulated automotive sensors—analyzing it for faults, predicting future issues, and delivering easy-to-understand explanations through a modern UI and GenAI mechanic assistant. It's designed to operate without requiring manual input: real-time telemetry flows in directly from OBD-II or CAN bus sources.

🎯 What Makes MechaMind+ Different
✅ No Manual Log Uploads – Data flows live from sensors or emulators


📡 Sensor-Driven Intelligence – Powered by OBD-II / CAN emulators


🧠 ML + GenAI – For subsystem health prediction and conversational diagnosis


📊 Live Dashboards & PDF Reports – Real-time visuals & exportable diagnostics


🔌 Modular Hardware – Easy integration via USB/Bluetooth, Raspberry Pi or Arduino



🔍 Core Problem It Solves
Challenge
Current Reality
MechaMind+ Solution
Drivers can’t interpret vehicle health
Technical fault codes, no summaries
GenAI explains issues like a mechanic
Health data is trapped in the vehicle
Needs mechanics or scan tools
Live dashboard on your screen
Static tools don’t predict issues
Reactive diagnostics only
ML models give early warnings
Hardware is often expensive or complex
High barrier to entry
Works with emulators or budget dongles
